# rockP
Rock paper scissors using enums..
In this simple project,to stress local python package
i have used python enumerated types that allows a user to input a string ie r for rock and the program outputs string rock.
when anouncing moves
instead of the input string r 

# functions
have cread multiple functions 
each function performs a specific task ie taking inputs 

# error handling
since a user can input an invalid option,
have used try: except : technic to handle the situation just after the user inputs an option..

# loops..
have used while loop so as the game be a cycle.until when a user interrupts it by a key strock != y/Y
